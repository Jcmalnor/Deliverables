How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It shows the exact locations of errors/changes in code.
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
This would help me follow my progress and use previous code as well if need be.
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Some systems are primarily used for separate unrelated files while others use multiple files for one project making it useful to be able to commit multiple files in one commit.
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
Git log opens all the commits that have been entered and git diff compares 2 different commits to see changes made.
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
I would be more confident in making changes because I could always check back with earlier commits if something goes wrong.
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Saving projects and creating some cool stuff!
